# Metro_map_Navigator

#### This project is a web application that displays metro routes and stops for a city using FastAPI, Leaflet.js and PostgreSQL. Users can input start and end points to find the shortest route, and the map dynamically updates to show the route and stops.

## Features

- Display metro stops on a map.
- Zoom up and down restricted to a certain level.
- Find and display the shortest route between two points based on distance and time.
- Redpoint indicates Start-Point and Green point indicates End-Point
- Highlight start and end points on the map.
- Use Docker for containerization and PostgreSQL as the database.
- Route Summary gives information about total distance and time, Change of Metro Lines and stops to travel along each line with ETA to each stop.
